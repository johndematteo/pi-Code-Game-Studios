## 4. Update AGENTS.md Technology Stack

### Language Selection (Godot only)

If Godot was chosen, ask the user which language to use **before** showing the proposed Technology Stack:

> "Godot supports two primary languages:
>
>   **A) GDScript** — Python-like, Godot-native, fastest iteration. Best for beginners, solo devs, and teams coming from Python or Lua.
>   **B) C#** — .NET 8+, familiar to Unity developers, stronger IDE tooling (Rider / Visual Studio), slight performance advantage on heavy logic.
>   **C) Both** — GDScript for gameplay/UI scripting, C# for performance-critical systems. Advanced setup — requires .NET SDK alongside Godot.
>
> Which will this project primarily use?"

Record the choice. It determines the AGENTS.md template, naming conventions, specialist routing, and which agent writes code files throughout the project.

### Primary Language (Unreal)

If Unreal was chosen, ask: "Will most gameplay logic live in
C++ or in Blueprints?" — `[A] C++ (Blueprints for tuning and prototyping)` /
`[B] Blueprint-primary (C++ only where needed)`. Default to C++ if the user has no
preference. The answer sets `engine.language` (`"C++"` or `"Blueprint"`).

Read `AGENTS.md` and show the user the proposed Technology Stack changes.
Ask: "May I write these engine settings to `AGENTS.md`?"

Wait for confirmation before making any edits.

Update the Technology Stack section, replacing the `[CHOOSE]` placeholders with the actual values:

**For Godot** — use the template matching the language chosen above. See `references/godot-language-config.md` (**A1**) for all three variants (GDScript, C#, Both).

**For Unity:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unity [version]
- **Language**: C#
- **Build System**: Unity Build Pipeline
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unity Asset Import Pipeline + Addressables
```

**For Web** — the four lines in `references/web.md` (W3).

**For Unreal:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine [version]
- **Language**: [C++ (primary), Blueprint (gameplay prototyping) | Blueprint (primary), C++ where needed]
- **Build System**: Unreal Build Tool (UBT)
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unreal Content Pipeline
```
The Language line follows the primary-language answer above: the first form for
`[A]` (`engine.language: "C++"`), the second for `[B]` (`"Blueprint"`).

**For Bevy** — the four lines in `references/bevy.md` (B3):
```markdown
- **Engine**: Bevy [version]
- **Language**: Rust
- **Build System**: Cargo — `cargo build` / `cargo run`
- **Asset Pipeline**: `assets/` is Bevy's AssetServer root; the asset processor writes `.meta` files beside each asset
```

### Engine reference import

In the same AGENTS.md write, set the **Engine Version Reference** import to the
chosen engine. Find the `ENGINE-REFERENCE-IMPORT` comment. With an
`@docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` line under it, Edit that line to point
at the configured engine; a line already pointing there is left as it is. With
none (the template ships with no import until an engine is set), insert the line
on its own right after the comment's closing `-->`:
- Godot → `@docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md`
- Unity → `@docs/engine-reference/unity/VERSION.md`
- Unreal → `@docs/engine-reference/unreal/VERSION.md`
- Web → `@docs/engine-reference/web/VERSION.md`
- Bevy → `@docs/engine-reference/bevy/VERSION.md`

This keeps a Unity or Unreal project from loading the Godot reference in every
session, and a project with no engine from loading any. It is idempotent —
re-running `/setup-engine` for a different engine rewrites the same line. (The target `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/`
directory is created in Section 7, Populate Engine Reference Docs, if it does not yet exist.)
